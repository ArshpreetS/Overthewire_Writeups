## What's a cookie

I am not going to make a dumb joke about the name "cookie". In easiest words, cookies are used to recoginize a user. 


In this challenge, we simply have to change the cookie:
```
__utma=176859643.878541458.1620330276.1622641965.1622647923.17; __utmz=176859643.1620524633.4.2.utmcsr=google|utmccn=(organic)|utmcmd=organic|utmctr=(not%20provided); __utmc=176859643; loggedin=0
```
You have guessed it right, loggedin should be 1 to get us the pass!
