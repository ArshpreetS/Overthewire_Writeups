There is a folder named *inhere*.

Enter the folder with the command: `cd inhere`

the folder is empty when we use the command: `ls`

As directed by the question: there must be a hidden file in here

so we use the command: `ls -a` 

**-a** shows the hidden files. (.hidden file is there)

`cat .hidden` --> to get the password

password --> `pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB`
